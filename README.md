## Key Notes
First, we need to get the word out.  There are many people who have never heard of Bitcoin or Ethereum and don't know what a DAO is. 

## Any other concrete outputs you're looking for?

Reflect on these governance polarities
Global <> the organization’s physical infrastructure <> Local

Decentralized <> how distributed amongst people is its decision making <> Centralized

## Caps and global constraints
Maximum total token holdings? Maximum burn rate of funds? What are users not allowed to do?

## Common proposals
What are the decisions the DAO takes on a daily basis and are not considered critical?

## Critical proposals
What are the critical decisions that the DAO can take that need a high degree of consensus?

## Legal strategy
How does the DAO negotiate it’s legitimacy with the legacy legal system?

## Doubts and concerns on the parameters
Questions, comments, and concerns go here.

## Stakeholder Analysis
From the users’ point of view, what is the DAO’s primary objective?
Should be one sentence or less.

## What connects your different user personas?
They might share goals, ambitions, ideology, or just the same office. What is it?

## How do users coordinate strategy, planning and direction?
Where/how does the community coordinate so that the DAO can operate in a peer to peer way?

## How can users leverage participation for individual benefit?
What do people get out of the DAO? Connecting their needs/desires to the collective process is important to keep your users engaged.

## Describe your user personas:
Think about their age, lifestyle, and goals.

Persona 1

Persona 2

Persona 3

Manage assets

### Democracy and Governance Chain
- We are creating a DAO community voting system. We will be using the blockchain to create a voting system that is transparent and incorruptible. This will allow for decisions to be made by the community as well as provide an audit trail of all transactions on the network.

Curate content

### Liberty Exchange
- The biggest project that will benefit the ecosystem is the development of a decentralized exchange. We are currently working on this and we have already started to develop it. This will be an open source decentralized exchange, which means there won't be any central authority controlling it or having access to your funds, so you can trade safely with other users in a peer-to-peer manner without having to trust anyone else but yourself.

etc..

## Ideal proposal types (brainstorm)
These types will help determine who gets tokens and how.

Budget / funding:

fundraising

one off proposals

monthly budgeting

etc...

If you plan on managing or allocating capital who are the funders? Why would they fund your DAO?
Is it top down (grants)? Bottom up (Moloch)? Do stakeholders pay subscription (membership dues)? Etc..
