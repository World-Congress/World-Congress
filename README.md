## Communication platforms
* [Discord] https://discord.gg/J4znnM46

## Knowledge repository
* [GitHub] https://github.com/World-Congress/library
* [Wiki] https://wiki.world-congress.org

## Community’s rhythms and rituals:
* Weekly Space w/ Fred #ConspiracyTheories 19:00 CET / 1PM EST @FredDiBiaseMDM
* Video Communty Call (1-2 per month)
- The most important thing is to have a clear agenda. The agenda should include the topics that are going to be discussed and how much time will be spent on each topic.
* Blogposts (4-5 per month)
* Podcasts (1-2 per month)

## Who is responsible?
* Holders of MGMT tokens govern the organisation
- It is important to note that this token does not represent equity in any way, shape or form. It is simply a mechanism to allow people who are interested in participating in the management of the fund (and therefore have an interest and stake on its success) to do so by using their tokens as votes.
* Holders of DMCRY tokens have one vote per token on all votes
- This is the most important token in the system. It is the token that is used to vote on the governance of the network.

## Member journey
* Agree to the statement of intent and the mission statement to become a member, you need to agree to mint the token. The token is free.

## How do new users catch up?
* Guides in Github Community folder

## How do you keep users engaged?
* Community Feedback Group
	- We have a community feedback group that meets once a week.
	- We can listen to all members of the local community by having a public meeting and inviting everyone in the area.
	- The rules should be simple and clear.  They should be stated in a positive way, not negative.
	- We need to be able to talk about our feelings and emotions. We need to be able to tell people what we are feeling.
	- We can make all races, religions and people feel safe and welcome by not being racist, bigoted or xenophobic.welcome by not being racist, bigoted or xenophobic.
* Community Action Group
* Community Response Group

## How does a user leave? Why might they do so?
* Request to leave, token will be revoked
* If code-of-conduct is broken token will be revoked

## Governance elements
Key performance indicators
What are you optimizing for?

* 25% active users (per week)
* 10%+ New members (per week)

## Key Notes
- First, we need to get the word out.  There are many people who have never heard of Bitcoin or Ethereum and don't know what a DAO is.
- The best way to get the word out is to tell your friends, family and neighbors. This is the first step.
- We will be working on a website and other marketing materials. We'll also have an online presence at  reddit .com/r/dawc
- To promote the DAO, we will be using the following:
* [Discord] 
- Be active, and be nice.  Don't ban people for being new or asking questions.  If you're a mod, don't abuse your powers (unless it's really funny).
* [GitHub]
- The most important thing is to be responsive
* [Wiki]
- We need to be careful not to create a wiki that is just a collection of information.  Information without action is useless.  A great example of this in the real world would be if we created an encyclopedia on how to build houses and then gave it away for free, but never taught anyone how to actually build them or helped people get access the materials they needed.
* [Blog]
- I think the blog should be a place where we can share ideas and inspiration. I'd like it to be a place where people can come together, not just as members of our community but also as part of other communities that they're involved in.
* [Podcasts]
- I think we should have a podcast that is focused on the best practices of creating a better world.

## Any other concrete outputs you're looking for?

Reflect on these governance polarities
Global <> the organization’s physical infrastructure <> Local

Decentralized <> how distributed amongst people is its decision making <> Centralized

## Caps and global constraints
Maximum total token holdings? Maximum burn rate of funds? What are users not allowed to do?

## Common proposals
What are the decisions the DAO takes on a daily basis and are not considered critical?

## Critical proposals
What are the critical decisions that the DAO can take that need a high degree of consensus?

## Legal strategy
How does the DAO negotiate it’s legitimacy with the legacy legal system?

## Doubts and concerns on the parameters
Questions, comments, and concerns go here.

## Stakeholder Analysis
From the users’ point of view, what is the DAO’s primary objective?
Should be one sentence or less.

## What connects your different user personas?
They might share goals, ambitions, ideology, or just the same office. What is it?

## How do users coordinate strategy, planning and direction?
Where/how does the community coordinate so that the DAO can operate in a peer to peer way?

## How can users leverage participation for individual benefit?
What do people get out of the DAO? Connecting their needs/desires to the collective process is important to keep your users engaged.

## Describe your user personas:
Think about their age, lifestyle, and goals.

Persona 1

Persona 2

Persona 3

## Projects
DAO functions
What do you want your DAO to do?

Manage assets

### Democracy and Governance Chain
- We are creating a DAO community voting system. We will be using the blockchain to create a voting system that is transparent and incorruptible. This will allow for decisions to be made by the community as well as provide an audit trail of all transactions on the network.

Curate content

### Liberty Exchange
- The biggest project that will benefit the ecosystem is the development of a decentralized exchange. We are currently working on this and we have already started to develop it. This will be an open source decentralized exchange, which means there won't be any central authority controlling it or having access to your funds, so you can trade safely with other users in a peer-to-peer manner without having to trust anyone else but yourself.

etc..

## Ideal proposal types (brainstorm)
These types will help determine who gets tokens and how.

Budget / funding:

fundraising

one off proposals

monthly budgeting

etc...

If you plan on managing or allocating capital who are the funders? Why would they fund your DAO?
Is it top down (grants)? Bottom up (Moloch)? Do stakeholders pay subscription (membership dues)? Etc..
