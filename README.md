Questions, comments, and concerns go here.

## Stakeholder Analysis

Should be one sentence or less.

## What connects your different user personas?
They might share goals, ambitions, ideology, or just the same office. What is it?

## How do users coordinate strategy, planning and direction?
Where/how does the community coordinate so that the DAO can operate in a peer to peer way?

## How can users leverage participation for individual benefit?
What do people get out of the DAO? Connecting their needs/desires to the collective process is important to keep your users engaged.

## Describe your user personas:
Think about their age, lifestyle, and goals.

Persona 1

Persona 2

Persona 3

## Actors
DAO functions
What do you want your DAO to do?

Manage assets

Create community votes

Curate content

Create a marketplace

etc..

## Ideal proposal types (brainstorm)
These types will help determine who gets tokens and how.

Budget / funding:

fundraising

one off proposals

monthly budgeting

etc...

If you plan on managing or allocating capital who are the funders? Why would they fund your DAO?
Is it top down (grants)? Bottom up (Moloch)? Do stakeholders pay subscription (membership dues)? Etc..
